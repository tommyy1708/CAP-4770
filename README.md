# CAP-4770

**A. Introduction**

This project aims to provide a comprehensive dataset of synthetic job postings to facilitate research and analysis in job market trends, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning. The dataset offers a diverse set of job listings across various industries and job types, created for educational and research purposes. Analyzing this dataset can help researchers and analysts gain insights into job market dynamics, improve job recommendation systems, and develop NLP models for resume parsing and job matching.

**B. Objectives**

- Provide a high-quality dataset of synthetic job postings for research and analysis.
- Explore job market trends and disparities through data analysis.
- Develop predictive models for forecasting job market trends.
- Enhance job recommendation systems for job seekers.

By the end of the semester, I intend to achieve a deep understanding of job market dynamics and trends through comprehensive data analysis, as well as develop predictive models and NLP solutions that can benefit job seekers and employers.

**C. Dataset Selection**

The dataset chosen for this project is a synthetic collection of job postings. It was selected for its comprehensive nature, offering a wide range of job listings across different industries and job types. The dataset's relevance lies in its ability to provide valuable insights into job market trends, NLP model development, and machine learning applications in the job market domain.

**D. Methodology**

The data mining techniques and methods that will be used include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model development. I plan to explore machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, Naive Bayesian algorithm, and Decision Tree algorithm for predictive modeling. Additionally, NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, word embedding, and text classification will be employed for resume parsing and job matching tasks.
